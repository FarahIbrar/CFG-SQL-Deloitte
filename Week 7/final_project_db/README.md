## Queries and Techniques

### Queries

**Find Playing XI for a Team:**
To find out the playing XI for any team (change t.team_name to the team you want).
```sql
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name
FROM Players p
JOIN Team_Players tp ON p.player_id = tp.player_id
JOIN Teams t ON tp.team_id = t.team_id
WHERE t.team_name = 'Brisbane Heat';
-- This query retrieves the names of players who are part of the playing XI for the specified team.
```

**Finding if all teams have exactly "11" players:**
```sql
SELECT t.team_name, COUNT(p.player_id) AS num_players
FROM Teams t
LEFT JOIN Players p ON t.team_id = p.team_id
GROUP BY t.team_name
HAVING COUNT(p.player_id) <> 11;
-- This query gives a list of teams that do not have exactly 11 players. 
-- If a team is missing players or has more than 11 players, it will be shown in the result. 
-- If a team has exactly 11 players, it will not be included in the result.
```

## Techniques Used
- **Normalization:** Ensuring data is organized to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Foreign Keys:** Establishing relationships between tables to maintain data consistency.
- **Indexes:** Improving query performance by creating indexes on frequently searched columns.
- **Subqueries:** Utilizing subqueries to fetch intermediate results used in the main query.
- **GROUP BY and HAVING:** Aggregating data and applying conditions on aggregated data to filter results.
- **Joins:** Using various types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.
- **COUNT:** Employing the COUNT function to count the number of items in a group, particularly useful in determining the number of players in a team.
